BanLister
=========

Collects syslogs and appends any IP addresses to a banlist.txt file, so long as the IP is not in the local exclusion.txt file.  This works nicely with TrustedSec's Project Artillery: https://github.com/trustedsec/artillery or Aclizer https://github.com/jabreity/Aclizer, my Cisco TCL script to maintain a deny list on a router, and update it on a schedule.
